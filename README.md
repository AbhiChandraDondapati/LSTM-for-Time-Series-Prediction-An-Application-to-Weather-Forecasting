## üìå Abstract

Forecasting weather conditions is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of meteorological data. This project introduces a weather prediction model using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, to predict temperature based on 20 years of historical data. By addressing issues such as data inconsistency and null values, the model achieves a prediction accuracy of 73.15%.
